# SkyChat
 SkyChat is a decentralized chat platform inspired by discord and slack.
 
 > With SkyChat you can make and join servers, add channels and talk there with up to 1000 users, sharing photos/videos or improving your messages with emojis :laughing:.
 
# Inner Workings
 SkyChat is using [Skynet](https://siasky.net/) for its decentralized hosting solution which is based on [sia](https://sia.tech/), a decentralized storing solution.
 
# Using SkyChat
 Because SkyChat uses Skynet as its backend, and Skynet has its own login solution (MySky) u will need to setup your MySky account.
 
 * MySky: https://skyprofile.hns.siasky.net/ (profile picture and username are required)
 
 Now when you open SkyChat you will be automatically loggen in.
 
 * SkyChat: https://skymessage-dac.hns.siasky.net/
 
# Important
 * All data on SkyChat is public, meaning if a user is dedicated enough he can modifiy the client get access to all the data, but that shouldn't be a problem on already public      server (note: message encryption is in works so private servers and dm's will be safe).
 
 * At the moment Skynet is very slow, and the messages can take up to 20 seconds (averaging 8 seconds) to get sent (this will improve with developers optimizing Skynet).
